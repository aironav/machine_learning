# where feature scaling matters are:
- k-nearest neighbors with an Euclidean distance measure is sensitive to magnitudes and hence should be scaled for all features to weigh in equally.
- Scaling is critical, while performing Principal Component Analysis(PCA). PCA tries to get the features with maximum variance and the variance is high for high magnitude features. This skews the PCA towards high magnitude features.
- We can speed up gradient descent by scaling. This is because Î¸ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.
- Tree based models are not distance based models and can handle varying ranges of features. Hence, Scaling is not required while modelling trees.
- Algorithms like Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), Naive Bayes are by design equipped to handle this and gives weights to the features accordingly. Performing a features scaling in these algorithms may not have much effect.
